      <description>BackgroundI donâ€™t remember when I first heard of Nassim N. Taleb, but I started reading his work a little more than a year ago. I usually struggle to understand some of his ideas or technical work but his work has personally been hard to shake off. I keep returning to his work and over time they tend to start making more and more sense the more I study them.</description>
