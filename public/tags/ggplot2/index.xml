      <description>MyAnimelist.netThis week TidyTuesday posted data from an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging website, MyAnimeList (MAL). This data will be interesting to examine because last summer I started watching anime shows and got hooked. I am a little embarrassed to admit it but Iâ€™ve seen a lot of different shows since then. I hope I get to find some new shows that I can watch later.</description>

      <description>Joining #TidyTuesdayEvery Tuesday, I often see submissions from the #rstats community on twitter about their #TidyTuesday projects. #TidyTuesdays are weekly data projects posted online by the R4DS (R for Data Science) community for anyone interested in working on developing their skills wrangling data within the R ecosystem. Feel free to check out the #tidytuesday repository on github for more information.
I felt it would be only natural for my first post to be joining this community and moving from being an observer to a participant.</description>
