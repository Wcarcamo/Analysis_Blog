      <description>Visual Basic for ApplicationsBack in August, I learned that with Microsoft Office products (i.e.Â Word, Excel, Access) you can write your own macros to help automate repetative tasks or create your own needed office functions that are not standard with office products to improve your workflow. I give props to Microsoft, because I have definitely been frustrated at times and wishing for more functionality from their products, but I understand they reach a global market and it is not possible to program everything people need in their products.</description>
