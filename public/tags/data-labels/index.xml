      <description>Data Visualization in R &amp;amp; LabelsI often treat building data visualizations in R as a fun puzzle. Prior to learning how to use ggplot2, I would do all of my graphs in excel. Making eye catching graphs in excel is often easier and quicker (especially if you follow Stephanie Evergreen). One feature that I really enjoy in excel is the ease of adding/removing data point labels and re-positioning them with a mouse to get them exactly where I want them, but excel is a tool designed by others for general use and has its own limitations.</description>
