      <description>Learning PythonI often see a debate online between Python and R as programming languages for Data Science. I am not interested in continuing that debate here, but rather just want to continue to learn other programming languages and have another tool available to use. I often read online Python is better for general use programming while R was developed with statisticians in mind. If that is the case I think it would be helpful to start learning Python and see where I can use it for my advantage.</description>
