      <description>Data Visualization in R &amp;amp; LabelsI often treat building data visualizations in R as a fun puzzle. Prior to learning how to use ggplot2, I would do all of my graphs in excel. Making eye catching graphs in excel is often easier and quicker (especially if you follow Stephanie Evergreen). One feature that I really enjoy in excel is the ease of adding/removing data point labels and re-positioning them with a mouse to get them exactly where I want them, but excel is a tool designed by others for general use and has its own limitations.</description>

      <description>Learning PythonThis post is a continuation of a learning python. In this post, I will extend the last post and focus on tidyverse equivalents to:
Mutate columnsSummarize data (Groupby)Pipe functions (%&amp;gt;%)Setting up Python in RmarkdownLoad Modules and Dataimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npurl = &amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-05-28/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv&amp;#39;dat = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0)Settings for better outputThis blog is built through the blogdown package and uses Rmarkdown files that render to HTML documents.</description>

      <description>Learning PythonI often see a debate online between Python and R as programming languages for Data Science. I am not interested in continuing that debate here, but rather just want to continue to learn other programming languages and have another tool available to use. I often read online Python is better for general use programming while R was developed with statisticians in mind. If that is the case I think it would be helpful to start learning Python and see where I can use it for my advantage.</description>

      <title>Tidy Tuesday - MyAnimeList</title>

      <description>MyAnimelist.netThis week TidyTuesday posted data from an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging website, MyAnimeList (MAL). This data will be interesting to examine because last summer I started watching anime shows and got hooked. I am a little embarrassed to admit it but Iâ€™ve seen a lot of different shows since then. I hope I get to find some new shows that I can watch later.</description>

      <description>Working with MapsIf you are interesting in learning about how to use R to work with geospatial data, I would first point you in the direction of reading Geocomputation in R. I previously thought that you had to use special software like ArcGIS in order to make maps but I found it not too difficult using certain R packages to make simple maps quickly.</description>

      <description>Joining #TidyTuesdayEvery Tuesday, I often see submissions from the #rstats community on twitter about their #TidyTuesday projects. #TidyTuesdays are weekly data projects posted online by the R4DS (R for Data Science) community for anyone interested in working on developing their skills wrangling data within the R ecosystem. Feel free to check out the #tidytuesday repository on github for more information.
I felt it would be only natural for my first post to be joining this community and moving from being an observer to a participant.</description>

      <description>.leaflet {margin: auto;}A New HobbyMy name is Will. I am not much of a programmer, but I am working on it. The first programming language I learned was R. I am trying to explore what I am capable of building with R and this site is one example of what someone can do. For me, this site is simply a place for me to track what I learn.</description>
