      <description>Joining #TidyTuesdayEvery Tuesday, I often see submissions from the #rstats community on twitter about their #TidyTuesday projects. #TidyTuesdays are weekly data projects posted online by the R4DS (R for Data Science) community for anyone interested in working on developing their skills wrangling data within the R ecosystem. Feel free to check out the #tidytuesday repository on github for more information.
I felt it would be only natural for my first post to be joining this community and moving from being an observer to a participant.</description>

      <description>A New HobbyMy name is Will. I am not much of a programmer, but I want to be. My first exposure to programming was through R. I am trying to explore what I am capable of building through R and this site is one example of what someone can do. For me, this site is simply a place for me to track what I learn.</description>
