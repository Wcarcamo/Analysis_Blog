<h1>Joining #TidyTuesday</h1>
<p>Every Tuesday, I often see submissions from the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#rstats</a> community on twitter about their <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#TidyTuesday</a> projects. #TidyTuesdays are weekly data projects posted online by the R4DS (R for Data Science) community for anyone interested in working on developing their skills wrangling data within the R ecosystem. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday" target="_blank">#tidytuesday</a> repository on github for more information.</p>
<p>I felt it would be only natural for my first post to be joining this community and moving from being an observer to a participant. The data posted this week comes from city of Seattle.</p>

<div id="seattle-bike-counters" class="section level1">
<h1>Seattle Bike Counters</h1>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>“Seattle Department of Transportation has 12 bike counters (four of which also count pedestrians) located on neighborhood greenways, multi-use trails, at the Fremont Bridge and on SW Spokane Street. The counters are helping us create a ridership baseline in 2014 that can be used to assess future years and make sure our investments are helping us to reach our goal of quadrupling ridership by 2030. Read our Bicycle Master Plan to learn more about what Seattle is doing to create a citywide bicycle network.” <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-04-02" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>The TidyTuesday repository also provides a “data dictionary” table in their repository that defines each variable so we can have a better understanding of what we are working. Instead of recreating it from scratch, I want to attempt to scrape the information from their github page. This might be overkill for a 6 X 3 table but I have recently stumbled upon <a href="https://m-clark.github.io/webR/" target="_blank">Engaging the Web with R</a> by Michael Clark. In it he demonstrated pulling data from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities,_villages,_and_townships_in_Michigan" target="_blank">table</a> found on Wikipedia. I was inspired to one day try it out myself and I think this is a great opportunity to implement it.</p>

<h2>Back to Business</h2>
<p>The data set we are working with includes a date and time of when data was collection, the location of the counter, the number of bikes and pedestrians crossing counter, and what direction they are heading.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of different analysis we can do with this data, for now I am going to just replicate some of the data visualizations composed the by Seattle Times about <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/what-we-can-learn-from-seattles-bike-counter-data/" target="_blank">What we can learn from Seattle’s bike counter data</a>. In their report, the Seattle Times disaggregated the data to see the average bike traffic across for each crossing during different time periods.</p>
<p>Before we clean up our data, I don’t know if you noticed but when I imported the data I manually entered the column types (except “date”, which we will fix later). When I ran the line of code as #TidyTuesday had posted, R was reading some of the columns incorrectly and returning values that I saw were highly skeptical (Good reminder always to check your raw data.).</p>
<p>For example, our ped_count was read as boolean and my values were either “NA”, “TRUE”, or “FALSE”. Our bike_count column was read as numeric but I was getting a count range from 0-8500. I don’t know about you, but this was a red flag for me. These bike counters are collecting counts at specific locations every hour. Trying to imagine that at 4:00 am on May 30, 2018 there were 8191 bikers crossing the South Burke Gilman Trail is a little humorous.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##   date                   crossing           direction bike_count ped_count

<p>I think its fair to believe there are a couple of errors during data collection, but I’ve never been to Seattle so I could be wrong. While I suspect some errors, in this post I am not going to make any assumptions to filter the counts and will use the data as is. Additionally, this post is about data wrangling and replicating some data visualizations, not having the most accurate data. So lets begin setting up our data.</p>

<h2>Creating Plots</h2>
<p>For each crossing we will have the average bike traffic by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>By Week</li>
<li>By Hour, During the Weekdays</li>
<li>By Hour, During the Weekends</li>

<p>There are six crossings, therefore we will have 24 plots in total. To save us from writing out the code for each individual plot we will do the following: For each plot, we will first perform our specific aggregation. Second, split our data into a list of data frames grouped by crossing. Third, we will map our ggplot2 code onto our list. Fourth, we will place the output into its own object. This object will be a list of our ggplots which we will call later to sort all our plots by crossing.</p>

<p>Now that we have our plots, we have to arrange them together.</p>
<p>The code below are the steps used to sort our plots for each crossing but only one crossing, Broadway Cycle Track, is shown to save space in the post. The process is repeated for each crossing. The only difference is swapping out the crossing variables in our ggplot lists.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># title
grid_title &lt;- ggdraw() + draw_label(&quot;Average Bike Traffic&quot;, fontface = &quot;bold&quot;)

# 2X2 grid of plots
broadway &lt;- plot_grid(
  p.year$`Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St`, # Replace variable &quot;Broadway...&quot; with another crossing for each ggplot2 list
  p.week$`Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St`, 
  p.weekday$`Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St`,
  p.weekend$`Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St`,
  ncol = 2
)
# add the title to grid
plot_grid(grid_title, broadway, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))</code></pre>
<p>Now we can sit back, view, and appreciate our plots for each crossing.</p>

<li>How to map ggplot2 onto a dataframe to create multiple plots that could be called individually later. Using the <em>facet</em> functions within ggplot2 would create the individual plots but I did not know how to seperate them to organize the plots by crossing instead of the ggplot object itself.</li>

<div id="how-i-will-be-move-forward" class="section level2">
<h2>How I will be move forward:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I will attempt to create more original content. My intentions for this post were simply to replicate the plots from Seattle Times article. However, I had issues with some of their formatting decisions. For example, they did not include numbers on their trend lines to have points of references for the average bike traffic which I also left out. (I recognize they include a description of peak bike crossings above the graphs, but in my opinion this is easy to overlook compared to when it is explicit on the plot itself.)</li>
<li>Approach future posts with specific topics and not deviate. Looking back, I feel I got sidetracked by experimenting with web scraping. I want others and myself to be able to find and reference either ideas or code without wasting time trying to remember which post it was in.</li>
